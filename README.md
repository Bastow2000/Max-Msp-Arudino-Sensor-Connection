# Max-Msp-Arudino-Sensor-Connection
QMUL University Assessment IDMT 2

For Exercise 2 you are going to explore gestural musical interaction. You will embed
a sensor into a physical object, design a gestural interaction, interface your system
between Arduino and Max, and explore different mapping strategies to generate
musical interactions.

I first made a dent in the ball.

 I secondly made sure I was getting values when squeezing from the sensor.

I soldered wires together for length.

I began soldering the HC-SR04 sensor, taping to reduce annoyance in the soldering process.

I then coded the mapping into Max MSP and connected the aurdino to the Max MSP patch.
